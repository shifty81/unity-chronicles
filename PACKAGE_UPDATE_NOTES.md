# Package Update Notes - November 2025

## Unity 6 LTS Compatibility Fix

### Problem
The project was experiencing compilation errors when opened in Unity 6 LTS (6000.0.62f1):

```
Library\PackageCache\com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@011cbda330b2\Editor\Tiles\AutoTile\AutoTileTemplate.cs(10,37): 
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'TileTemplate' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)

Library\PackageCache\com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@011cbda330b2\Editor\Tiles\RuleTile\RuleTileTemplate.cs(11,37): 
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'TileTemplate' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```

Additionally, Visual Studio Code editor integration was showing as deprecated.

### Root Cause
1. **Tilemap Extras Package**: Version 4.2.3 of `com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras` is not compatible with Unity 6 LTS. The `TileTemplate` class doesn't exist in the Unity 6 version of this package.

2. **VS Code Package**: Version 1.2.5 of `com.unity.ide.vscode` is deprecated and not supported in Unity 6 LTS. Unity stopped maintaining this package starting with Unity 2023.1.

### Solution
Updated `Packages/manifest.json`:

1. **Updated tilemap.extras**: Changed from `4.2.3` to `6.0.1`
   - Version 6.0.1 is officially compatible with Unity 6 LTS
   - Includes all necessary brushes and tiles without the deprecated `TileTemplate` type

2. **Removed VS Code package**: Removed `com.unity.ide.vscode@1.2.5`
   - This package is no longer maintained by Unity
   - Users should install Microsoft's [Unity for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudiotoolsforunity.vstuc) extension directly from VS Code marketplace
   - Also requires [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension

### Changes Made
- `Packages/manifest.json`: Updated package versions
- `PROJECT_STATUS_UNITY.md`: Added notes about package updates

### Impact
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ All C# scripts continue to work (they only use `UnityEngine.Tilemaps`, not extras-specific types)
- ✅ Project will now open without compilation errors in Unity 6 LTS
- ⚠️ `packages-lock.json` will be automatically regenerated by Unity when the project is opened

### Next Steps for Developers
1. Open the project in Unity 6 LTS
2. Unity will automatically resolve and download the updated packages
3. The `packages-lock.json` file will be regenerated
4. If using Visual Studio Code, install the recommended extensions:
   - [Unity for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudiotoolsforunity.vstuc)
   - [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
