## Phase 3: Research and Reference Implementation

### 3.1 Games Using 2D Terrain with Vertical Depth - What They Do Well

#### Terraria (2011 - Present)
**What It Does Well:**
- **Deep Underground System**: Multiple distinct underground layers with unique content
- **Biome Diversity**: Surface biomes extend underground with unique caves
- **Mining Progression**: Tools get better, allowing access to deeper, harder materials
- **Hidden Treasures**: Chests, rare ores, and secrets reward exploration
- **Cave Systems**: Organic cave generation feels natural and explorable
- **Building**: Can build anywhere, both above and below ground

**Technical Highlights:**
- 2D tile-based world (8000+ blocks wide, 2400+ blocks deep)
- Perlin noise for surface terrain
- Cellular automata for cave generation
- Multiple underground "depth zones" with different content
- Ore veins using noise-based placement

**Underground Layers:**
```
Surface (0-50 blocks): Grass, trees, normal enemies
Underground (50-400): Stone caves, common ores, basic enemies
Cavern (400-1200): Large caves, better ores, tougher enemies
Underworld (1200+): Lava, hellstone, hardmode enemies
```

#### Starbound (2016)
**What It Does Well:**
- **Planet Generation**: Each planet has unique surface and underground
- **Background Layers**: Multiple visual layers create depth perception
- **Biome Variation**: Underground reflects surface biome characteristics
- **Ore Distribution**: Logical ore placement by depth
- **Underground Structures**: Ruins, bunkers, and dungeons underground

**Technical Highlights:**
- Procedural 2D worlds with seamless wrapping
- Noise-based terrain and cave generation
- JSON-defined biomes for easy modding
- Layer-based rendering system
- Quest markers guide exploration

#### Dig Dug (Classic Reference)
**What It Does Well (Despite Simplicity):**
- **Simple Depth Mechanic**: Clear understanding of digging down
- **Enemy Spawning**: Different enemies at different depths
- **Score by Depth**: Deeper = more valuable
- **Path Creation**: Player creates their own tunnels

#### Motherload (Flash Game)
**What It Does Well:**
- **Depth-Based Progression**: Must upgrade to dig deeper
- **Resource Management**: Fuel and cargo space force surface trips
- **Hazards by Depth**: Different dangers at different levels
- **Ore Value Scaling**: Deeper = more valuable resources

**Core Loop:**
```
1. Dig down to find valuable ores
2. Return to surface to sell
3. Upgrade drill, fuel tank, cargo
4. Dig deeper for better resources
5. Repeat
```

#### SteamWorld Dig (2013)
**What It Does Well:**
- **Metroidvania Digging**: Upgrades unlock deeper areas
- **Permanent Changes**: Digging is destructive and permanent
- **Light Management**: Darkness increases with depth
- **Vertical Platforming**: Climbing back up is part of the challenge
- **Strategic Digging**: Plan your path carefully (limited resources)

**Technical Highlights:**
- Hand-crafted main path with procedural side areas
- Lighting system affects gameplay
- Upgrade-gated progression
- Risk/reward depth mechanics

**Depth System:**
```
Level 1 (0-50m): Tutorial area, basic enemies, common ores
Level 2 (50-150m): Tougher enemies, need better drill
Level 3 (150-300m): Lava hazards, rare ores, boss enemies
```

#### Minecraft (2D Perspective)
**What It Does Well:**
- **Logical Layers**: Dirt → Stone → Deep slate → Bedrock
- **Ore Distribution**: Each ore has optimal depth range
- **Cave Systems**: Pre-generated caves to discover while mining
- **Risk vs Reward**: Deeper = better loot but harder enemies
- **Lighting Mechanics**: Torches required for safe mining

**Ore Distribution by Depth:**
```
Y 64+  : Coal, emerald (mountains)
Y 0-64 : Coal, iron, gold, redstone
Y 0-16 : Diamond, lapis, redstone (abundant)
Y -64  : Deep slate, ancient cities
```

### 3.2 Games Using Fractal Noise Maps for 2D Terrain - Implementation Details

#### Terraria - Multi-Layer Noise Approach
**Implementation:**
- **Surface Height**: Perlin noise creates rolling hills
  - Base frequency: 0.01 (gentle slopes)
  - Octaves: 4-5 for detail
  - Height variation: 20-40 blocks
  
- **Cave Systems**: Multiple noise layers create organic caves
  - Large cave noise: 0.02 frequency (big chambers)
  - Small cave noise: 0.05 frequency (tunnels)
  - Worley noise: Creates cellular patterns
  
- **Ore Veins**: Perlin noise determines ore placement
  - Each ore has unique noise seed
  - Depth-based probability threshold
  - Blob-like vein shapes

**Code Concept:**
```csharp
float GenerateSurfaceHeight(int x)
{
    float height = 100f; // Base level
    height += PerlinNoise(x * 0.01f) * 30f; // Major hills
    height += PerlinNoise(x * 0.05f) * 10f; // Small variation
    height += PerlinNoise(x * 0.1f) * 3f;   // Fine detail
    return height;
}

bool IsCave(int x, int y)
{
    float caveNoise = PerlinNoise(x * 0.02f, y * 0.02f);
    float threshold = 0.5f + (y * 0.001f); // More caves deeper
    return caveNoise > threshold;
}

bool IsOre(int x, int y, OreType oreType)
{
    if (y < oreType.MinDepth || y > oreType.MaxDepth)
        return false;
        
    float oreNoise = PerlinNoise(x * 0.08f, y * 0.08f, oreType.Seed);
    return oreNoise > oreType.Threshold;
}
```

#### Starbound - Planet-Specific Noise
**Implementation:**
- **Biome Selection**: Low-frequency noise determines biome zones
- **Terrain Shape**: Medium-frequency noise creates surface contours
- **Detail Layer**: High-frequency noise adds small variations
- **Underground Composition**: Noise determines block types by depth

**Biome Blending:**
```csharp
Biome GetBiomeAt(int x)
{
    float biomeNoise = PerlinNoise(x * 0.001f);
    float moistureNoise = PerlinNoise(x * 0.0015f + 1000f);
    
    if (biomeNoise < 0.3f) return Biome.Desert;
    if (biomeNoise < 0.6f && moistureNoise > 0.5f) return Biome.Forest;
    if (biomeNoise < 0.6f) return Biome.Plains;
    return Biome.Mountains;
}
```

#### No Man's Sky (2D) - Advanced Layering
**Implementation:**
- **Continental Scale**: Very low frequency (0.0001-0.0005)
- **Regional Features**: Low frequency (0.001-0.005)
- **Local Terrain**: Medium frequency (0.01-0.05)
- **Surface Detail**: High frequency (0.1-0.5)

**Domain Warping for Organic Shapes:**
```csharp
float DomainWarpedHeight(int x)
{
    // Warp the input coordinates
    float warpX = PerlinNoise(x * 0.01f) * 50f;
    float actualX = x + warpX;
    
    // Sample height at warped position
    float height = PerlinNoise(actualX * 0.005f) * 40f;
    return height;
}
```

#### Spelunky - Controlled Randomness
**Implementation:**
- **Room Templates**: Pre-designed room types
- **Noise for Variation**: Slight variations within templates
- **Path Guaranteed**: Ensures a valid path through level
- **Challenge Placement**: Noise determines trap/enemy positions

**Hybrid Approach:**
```csharp
void GenerateLevel()
{
    // Use grid-based layout
    Room[,] rooms = new Room[4, 4];
    
    // Perlin noise selects room types
    for (int x = 0; x < 4; x++)
    {
        for (int y = 0; y < 4; y++)
        {
            float noise = PerlinNoise(x * 0.25f, y * 0.25f);
            rooms[x, y] = SelectRoomType(noise);
        }
    }
    
    // Add noise-based decorations
    AddNoiseDecorations(rooms);
}
```

## Phase 4: Camera System for Semi-Angled Top-Down View

### 4.1 Orthographic Projection Camera

**Core Principle**: Use an orthographic camera looking straight down (not perspective). The "semi-angled" look comes from the art/sprites themselves, not from camera trickery.

#### Why Orthographic?
- **Consistent Scale**: Objects don't appear smaller when "further away"
- **Predictable Gameplay**: Players can judge distances accurately
- **2D-Friendly**: Perfect for top-down and isometric-style games
- **Performance**: Simpler rendering calculations than perspective

#### Implementation
```csharp
// Chronicles of a Drifter already uses orthographic projection
// The CameraComponent uses direct 2D transformations:
var (screenX, screenY) = camera.WorldToScreen(worldX, worldY);

// No perspective division, just:
// screenX = (worldX - cameraX) * zoom + viewportWidth / 2
// screenY = (worldY - cameraY) * zoom + viewportHeight / 2
```

### 4.2 Semi-Angled Art Style (Not Camera Angle!)

**Key Concept**: The camera looks straight down (0°), but sprites and tiles are drawn at a fixed angle.

#### Recommended Angles
- **45°**: Classic isometric (equal x and y projection)
- **30°**: Steeper isometric (more top-down feeling)
- **25°**: Zelda-style (slight angle, mostly top-down)
- **60°**: Shallow angle (more side-view)

#### Art Pipeline
```
1. Create sprites/tiles at chosen angle (e.g., 45°)
2. Export as 2D images
3. Render with orthographic camera
4. Result: Consistent "2.5D" appearance
```

#### Example Sprite Specifications
```
Character Sprite (45° angle):
- Base: 32×32 pixels
- Head drawn at 45° angle
- Shoulders visible from top-down perspective
- Feet at bottom of sprite
- Shadow underneath (circular)

Tile Sprite (45° angle):
- Size: 32×32 pixels
- Top face visible
- Front edge visible at angle
- Consistent lighting from top-left
```

### 4.3 Parallax Scrolling System

**Purpose**: Create illusion of depth by moving background layers at different speeds.

#### Layer Structure (Back to Front)
```
Layer 0: Far mountains      (parallax factor: 0.2 - slowest)
Layer 1: Distant trees      (parallax factor: 0.4)
Layer 2: Mid-ground         (parallax factor: 0.7)
Layer 3: Ground/Terrain     (parallax factor: 1.0 - moves with camera)
Layer 4: Player/Entities    (parallax factor: 1.0)
Layer 5: Foreground trees   (parallax factor: 1.2 - faster than camera)
```

#### Implementation
```csharp
public class ParallaxLayer
{
    public Texture Texture { get; set; }
    public float ParallaxFactor { get; set; }  // 0.0 to 2.0
    public float ScrollSpeedX { get; set; }    // Optional auto-scroll
    public float ScrollSpeedY { get; set; }
    public int ZOrder { get; set; }            // Rendering order
}

public class ParallaxSystem : ISystem
{
    private List<ParallaxLayer> _layers;
    
    public void Update(World world, float deltaTime)
    {
        var camera = CameraSystem.GetActiveCamera(world);
        if (camera == null) return;
        
        foreach (var layer in _layers.OrderBy(l => l.ZOrder))
        {
            // Calculate parallax offset
            float offsetX = camera.X * layer.ParallaxFactor;
            float offsetY = camera.Y * layer.ParallaxFactor;
            
            // Optional auto-scroll (e.g., for clouds)
            offsetX += layer.ScrollSpeedX * totalTime;
            offsetY += layer.ScrollSpeedY * totalTime;
            
            // Render layer at calculated offset
            RenderLayer(layer, offsetX, offsetY);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Best Practices
- **Background layers**: Use parallax < 1.0 (move slower than camera)
- **Foreground layers**: Use parallax > 1.0 (move faster than camera)
- **Main gameplay layer**: Always use parallax = 1.0
- **Vertical parallax**: More effective for top-down games to show height
- **Repeating textures**: Use seamless tiling for infinite backgrounds

### 4.4 Smooth Following (Damped Follow)

**Already Implemented**: Chronicles of a Drifter uses exponential smoothing via Lerp.

#### Current Implementation
```csharp
// In CameraSystem.cs
float t = 1.0f - MathF.Exp(-followSpeed * deltaTime);
camera.X = Lerp(camera.X, target.X, t);
camera.Y = Lerp(camera.Y, target.Y, t);
```

#### Follow Speed Recommendations
- **Slow (2-4)**: Cinematic, exploration games
- **Medium (5-8)**: ✅ **Recommended for Chronicles of a Drifter**
- **Fast (10-15)**: Action games, combat focus
- **Instant (0)**: Puzzle games, strategic games

### 4.5 Look-Ahead Feature

**Purpose**: Shift camera focus in the direction of player movement, showing more of what's ahead.

#### Implementation
```csharp
public class CameraLookAheadSystem : ISystem
{
    private float _lookAheadDistance = 100f;  // How far ahead to look
    private float _lookAheadSpeed = 3f;       // How fast to adjust
    private Vector2 _currentLookAhead;
    
    public void Update(World world, float deltaTime)
    {
        var camera = CameraSystem.GetActiveCamera(world);
        if (camera?.FollowTarget == null) return;
        
        var targetPos = world.GetComponent<PositionComponent>(camera.FollowTarget);
        var targetVel = world.GetComponent<VelocityComponent>(camera.FollowTarget);
        
        if (targetPos != null && targetVel != null)
        {
            // Calculate desired look-ahead offset based on velocity
            float speed = MathF.Sqrt(targetVel.VX * targetVel.VX + targetVel.VY * targetVel.VY);
            
            if (speed > 0.1f)  // Only look ahead if moving
            {
                Vector2 direction = new Vector2(
                    targetVel.VX / speed,
                    targetVel.VY / speed
                );
                
                Vector2 targetLookAhead = direction * _lookAheadDistance;
                
                // Smoothly interpolate current look-ahead to target
                float t = 1.0f - MathF.Exp(-_lookAheadSpeed * deltaTime);
                _currentLookAhead.X = Lerp(_currentLookAhead.X, targetLookAhead.X, t);
                _currentLookAhead.Y = Lerp(_currentLookAhead.Y, targetLookAhead.Y, t);
            }
            else
            {
                // Return to center when stopped
                float t = 1.0f - MathF.Exp(-_lookAheadSpeed * deltaTime);
                _currentLookAhead.X = Lerp(_currentLookAhead.X, 0, t);
                _currentLookAhead.Y = Lerp(_currentLookAhead.Y, 0, t);
            }
            
            // Adjust camera follow target with look-ahead offset
            // Note: Don't modify target entity, modify camera's target position
            camera.X += _currentLookAhead.X / 10f;  // Scale down for subtle effect
            camera.Y += _currentLookAhead.Y / 10f;
        }
    }
}
```

#### When to Use Look-Ahead
- ✅ **Fast-paced action**: Player needs to see threats ahead
- ✅ **Racing/running games**: Essential for forward visibility
- ✅ **Platformers**: Helps with jump planning
- ❌ **Slow exploration**: Can be disorienting
- ❌ **Puzzle games**: Not needed, can be distracting

### 4.6 Camera Bounds

**Already Implemented**: Chronicles of a Drifter has camera bounds via `SetBounds()`.

#### Implementation Considerations for 2D World
```csharp
// For a world with chunks that are 32 blocks wide × 30 blocks tall
// With 16 chunks loaded (512 blocks wide)
int worldWidth = 512 * blockSize;  // e.g., 512 * 32 = 16,384 pixels
int worldHeight = 30 * blockSize;  // e.g., 30 * 32 = 960 pixels

// Camera bounds should account for viewport size
float halfViewportWidth = camera.ViewportWidth / (2.0f * camera.Zoom);
float halfViewportHeight = camera.ViewportHeight / (2.0f * camera.Zoom);

CameraSystem.SetBounds(world, cameraEntity,
    minX: halfViewportWidth,
    maxX: worldWidth - halfViewportWidth,
    minY: halfViewportHeight,
    maxY: worldHeight - halfViewportHeight
);
```

#### Dynamic Bounds for Infinite Worlds
```csharp
// Update bounds as player explores
public void UpdateCameraBounds(World world, Entity camera, int chunksLoaded)
{
    int worldWidth = chunksLoaded * chunkWidth * blockSize;
    
    var cam = world.GetComponent<CameraComponent>(camera);
    float halfViewportWidth = cam.ViewportWidth / (2.0f * cam.Zoom);
    float halfViewportHeight = cam.ViewportHeight / (2.0f * cam.Zoom);
    
    // Expand bounds as world grows
    CameraSystem.SetBounds(world, camera,
        minX: halfViewportWidth,
        maxX: worldWidth - halfViewportWidth,
        minY: halfViewportHeight,
        maxY: (30 * blockSize) - halfViewportHeight  // Fixed vertical
    );
}
```

### 4.7 Advanced Camera Features

#### Screen Shake
```csharp
public class ScreenShakeEffect
{
    private float _intensity;
    private float _duration;
    private float _elapsed;
    
    public void Trigger(float intensity, float duration)
    {
        _intensity = intensity;
        _duration = duration;
        _elapsed = 0;
    }
    
    public Vector2 GetOffset(float deltaTime)
    {
        if (_elapsed >= _duration) return Vector2.Zero;
        
        _elapsed += deltaTime;
        float progress = _elapsed / _duration;
        float currentIntensity = _intensity * (1.0f - progress);  // Fade out
        
        return new Vector2(
            (Random.Shared.NextSingle() * 2 - 1) * currentIntensity,
            (Random.Shared.NextSingle() * 2 - 1) * currentIntensity
        );
    }
}

// Usage in CameraSystem:
var shakeOffset = _screenShake.GetOffset(deltaTime);
camera.X += shakeOffset.X;
camera.Y += shakeOffset.Y;
```

#### Camera Zones
```csharp
public class CameraZone
{
    public Rectangle Bounds { get; set; }
    public float FollowSpeed { get; set; }
    public float Zoom { get; set; }
    public bool EnableLookAhead { get; set; }
}

// Change camera behavior when entering different zones
// E.g., slower follow in safe town, fast follow in combat area
```

### 4.8 Performance Optimization

#### Rendering with Camera
```csharp
// Only render what's visible in camera viewport
public void RenderVisibleTiles(CameraComponent camera)
{
    // Calculate visible tile range
    int minTileX = (int)((camera.X - viewportHalfWidth) / tileSize);
    int maxTileX = (int)((camera.X + viewportHalfWidth) / tileSize) + 1;
    int minTileY = (int)((camera.Y - viewportHalfHeight) / tileSize);
    int maxTileY = (int)((camera.Y + viewportHalfHeight) / tileSize) + 1;
    
    // Only render tiles in visible range
    for (int y = minTileY; y <= maxTileY; y++)
    {
        for (int x = minTileX; x <= maxTileX; x++)
        {
            RenderTile(x, y);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Parallax Layer Optimization
```csharp
// Don't update/render parallax layers every frame if they barely move
if (Math.Abs(camera.X - _lastCameraX) > 5f)
{
    UpdateParallaxLayers();
    _lastCameraX = camera.X;
}
```
