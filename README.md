### Building Locally

**Note:** This project is configured for **Windows-only** with **DirectX 11 as the default renderer**. The renderer can be changed in the game settings menu (the game will restart with the new renderer).

#### Quick Build (Recommended for Local Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shifty81/ChroniclesOfADrifter.git
cd ChroniclesOfADrifter

# Run the automated build script (Windows only)
build.bat

# Run the game (default: DirectX 11 renderer on Windows)
cd src/Game
dotnet run -c Release

# Use DirectX 12 renderer on Windows (high performance, requires compatible GPU)
set CHRONICLES_RENDERER=dx12  # Windows Command Prompt
# or
$env:CHRONICLES_RENDERER="dx12"  # Windows PowerShell
dotnet run -c Release

# Use SDL2 renderer (optional, for cross-platform testing if SDL2 is installed)
set CHRONICLES_RENDERER=sdl2  # Windows Command Prompt
# or
$env:CHRONICLES_RENDERER="sdl2"  # Windows PowerShell
dotnet run -c Release
```

#### Using Visual Studio 2022 (Recommended for Debugging)

**For the best debugging experience with mixed-mode C++/C# debugging:**

1. Open `ChroniclesOfADrifter.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Select **Build → Build Solution** (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Press **F5** to start debugging with breakpoints in both C++ and C# code

See the **[Visual Studio 2022 Setup Guide](docs/VS2022_SETUP.md)** for detailed instructions.

#### Manual Build
