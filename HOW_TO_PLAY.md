- **Terrain Demo**: ~40-60 FPS (with chunk generation)
- **Mining Demo**: Smooth 60 FPS with lighting effects

## Renderer Selection (Windows Only)

By default, the game uses SDL2 renderer (cross-platform). On Windows, you can select different renderers:

```bash
# DirectX 11 (broad hardware support)
set CHRONICLES_RENDERER=dx11
dotnet run -c Release

# DirectX 12 (high performance)
set CHRONICLES_RENDERER=dx12
dotnet run -c Release
```

## Troubleshooting

### Game won't build
- Make sure you have .NET 9 SDK installed
- Make sure you have CMake 3.20+ installed
- On Linux: Install SDL2 with `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev`

### Low FPS in console mode
- This is expected due to console rendering overhead
- Use `visual` mode for better performance

### Crashes on startup
- Check that the C++ engine built successfully
- Verify SDL2 is installed (Linux)
- Try running with `--no-logo` flag

## Next Steps

After playing through the demos:
1. Try different demo modes to see all systems
2. Explore different biomes in terrain mode
3. Dig deep underground in mining mode
4. Complete quests in hybrid mode
5. Test combat in the main playable demo

## Development Status

**Current Phase:** Implementation Complete ✅

All major systems are implemented and working:
- ✅ Core engine (C++ with DirectX 11/12 + SDL2)
- ✅ Game logic (.NET 9 C#)
- ✅ Terrain generation with biomes
- ✅ Combat and AI systems
- ✅ Mining and crafting
- ✅ Full gameplay loop

The game is **fully playable** through the various demo modes. Each demo showcases different aspects of the complete game experience.
