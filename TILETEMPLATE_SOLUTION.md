# TileTemplate Error - Complete Solution Guide

## The Problem

When opening this Unity 6 LTS project, you may encounter these compilation errors:

```
Library\PackageCache\com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@[hash]\Editor\Tiles\AutoTile\AutoTileTemplate.cs(12,37): 
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'TileTemplate' could not be found

Library\PackageCache\com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@[hash]\Editor\Tiles\RuleTile\RuleTileTemplate.cs(13,37): 
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'TileTemplate' could not be found
```

## Why This Happens

**This is a bug in version 6.0.1 of the `com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras` package.** In that version, the `AutoTileTemplate` and `RuleTileTemplate` classes inherit from a `TileTemplate` base class that doesn't exist in the package.

This project has been updated to use version **7.0.0** which fixes this issue. However, if you're still seeing the error, Unity may be using **cached files from the older buggy version** (6.0.1 or earlier).

Even though the project's `manifest.json` and `packages-lock.json` specify version 7.0.0, Unity has multiple cache locations that can serve stale packages:

1. **Project cache**: `Library/PackageCache/` (specific to this project)
2. **System-wide cache**: OS-specific location (shared across all Unity projects)
   - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Unity\cache`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Unity/cache`
   - Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/cache`

The standard "delete Library folder" fix only clears #1. **To completely fix the TileTemplate bug, you need to clear cached versions so Unity downloads the fixed version 7.0.0 from the Unity Registry.**

## The Solution

### Step 1: Diagnose (Recommended)

First, verify what's actually wrong:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\verify-packages.ps1

# macOS/Linux
./verify-packages.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check your Unity version
- ✅ Verify package versions in manifest and lock file
- ✅ Scan cached packages for TileTemplate references
- ✅ Tell you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it

### Step 2: Fix - Standard Cleanup

If Step 1 found issues, start with the standard cleanup:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\cleanup-unity-cache.ps1

# macOS/Linux
./cleanup-unity-cache.sh
```

**Before running:**
- Close Unity Editor completely
- Save your work

**What it does:**
- Removes `Library/PackageCache/` (project-level cache)
- Removes `Packages/packages-lock.json`
- Or removes entire `Library/` folder (you choose)

**After running:**
- Open project through Unity Hub
- Wait 2-5 minutes for Unity to reimport assets
- Check Console for errors

### Step 3: Fix - Advanced Cleanup (If Standard Didn't Work)

**Still getting errors?** Use the advanced cleanup:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\advanced-cleanup.ps1

# macOS/Linux
./advanced-cleanup.sh
```

**Before running:**
- Close Unity Editor completely
- **ALSO close Unity Hub** (important!)
- Save your work

**What it does (more aggressive):**
- Removes entire `Library/` folder
- Removes `Packages/packages-lock.json`
- Removes `Temp/` folder
- **Removes system-wide Unity package cache** ⭐ This is the key difference!

**After running:**
- Open Unity Hub
- Open project through Unity Hub
- Wait 5-10 minutes for Unity to:
  - Regenerate Library folder
  - Download packages from Unity Registry
  - Reimport all assets
- Check Console - errors should be gone

### Why Advanced Cleanup Works

The advanced cleanup clears **system-wide Unity caches** that persist even after deleting the project's Library folder. This forces Unity to download the correct version (7.0.0) from the Unity Package Registry, which has the bug fixed.

Unity will automatically regenerate all deleted caches from:
- Your project's `manifest.json` (specifies package version 7.0.0)
- Unity Package Registry (downloads version 7.0.0 with the fix)
- Your Assets folder (source of truth)

Nothing is permanently lost - everything is rebuilt correctly with the fixed package version.

## Quick Reference

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| First time seeing error | Run `cleanup-unity-cache` |
| Error persists after cleanup | Run `advanced-cleanup` |
| Want to check what's wrong | Run `verify-packages` |
| Error after Unity/package update | Run `cleanup-unity-cache` |
| Multiple projects affected | Run `advanced-cleanup` (clears shared cache) |

## Still Having Issues?

If errors persist even after advanced cleanup:

1. **Verify Unity version**: Ensure you're using Unity 6 LTS (6000.0.x)
2. **Update Unity Hub**: Old Hub versions can cache incorrectly
3. **Check Unity Registry access**: Ensure you can reach `packages.unity.com`
4. **Try Unity safe mode**: Open with specific rendering (Windows: `Unity.exe -force-d3d11`)
5. **Nuclear option**: See TROUBLESHOOTING.md section "Last resort"

## What Files Are Safe to Delete?

✅ **Safe to delete (regenerated by Unity):**
- `Library/` folder
- `Temp/` folder
- `Packages/packages-lock.json`
- `obj/` folder (if exists)
- System-wide Unity caches

❌ **NEVER delete:**
- `Assets/` folder
- `ProjectSettings/` folder
- `Packages/manifest.json`
- Your C# scripts
- Your scenes

## Understanding the Scripts

### verify-packages
- **Purpose**: Read-only diagnostics
- **Safe**: Yes - makes no changes
- **When**: Before cleanup, or to check if problem is fixed
- **Time**: Instant

### cleanup-unity-cache
- **Purpose**: Standard cache cleanup
- **Safe**: Yes - removes only regenerable caches
- **When**: First attempt at fixing errors
- **Time**: Instant script, 2-5 min Unity reimport

### advanced-cleanup
- **Purpose**: Aggressive cleanup including global caches
- **Safe**: Yes - all removed files are regenerated
- **When**: Standard cleanup didn't fix the problem
- **Time**: Instant script, 5-10 min Unity reimport

## Prevention

To avoid this problem in the future:

1. **Always use Unity Hub** to open projects
2. **Keep Unity 6 LTS updated** to latest patch version
3. **Close Unity completely** when running cleanup scripts
4. **Close Unity Hub too** when running advanced cleanup
5. **Don't manually edit** `Library/PackageCache/`
6. **After package updates**, close and reopen Unity

## Technical Deep Dive

For those interested in the technical details:

**Unity Package Resolution:**
1. Unity reads `Packages/manifest.json` for package dependencies
2. Checks `Packages/packages-lock.json` for locked versions
3. Looks in project cache: `Library/PackageCache/`
4. If not found, looks in system cache: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Unity\cache` (Windows)
5. If not found, downloads from `packages.unity.com`

**The Bug:**
Version 6.0.1 of `com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras` had a bug where `AutoTileTemplate` and `RuleTileTemplate` classes inherited from a `TileTemplate` base class that didn't exist in the package. This bug was present in the package on the Unity Registry.

**The Fix:**
This project now uses version 7.0.0 which fixes the bug. However, Unity's cache resolution sometimes uses #3 or #4 even when the manifest specifies a different version, especially if the buggy version (6.0.1) was previously cached. Clearing both project-level (#3) and system-level (#4) caches forces Unity to download the fixed version (#5) specified in the manifest.
